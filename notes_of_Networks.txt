These are personal notes that I use to keep truck of which networks I am training and with wich settings. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
folder: /hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version0/

This is worked fine. There was a small bug in the SLC time maps but overall accuracy was above 0.81
I pushed this into github 28.07.
It used both time maps hlc and SLC
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.

/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version1/

This corrected the above bug. For the rest it was unchanged. It also includes the time range of the event.
Time end - time start including the slc and hlc hits. 
circa 175 epochs. Accuracy little more then 0.81. Loss around 2.0. 
The beggining of the training was somehow strange. 
It took a long time to train for some reson. I would not use this for any purposes.
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version2/

Same as above it does not include the time difference just the improved time maps 
Well trained however, 
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.
It will be retrained.
