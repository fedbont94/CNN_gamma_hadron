These are personal notes that I use to keep truck of which networks I am training and with wich settings. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
folder: /hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version0/

This is worked fine. There was a small bug in the SLC time maps but overall accuracy was above 0.81
I pushed this into github 28.07.
It used both time maps hlc and SLC
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version1/

This corrected the above bug. For the rest it was unchanged. It also includes the time range of the event.
Time end - time start including the slc and hlc hits. 
circa 175 epochs. Accuracy little more then 0.81. Loss around 2.0. 
The beggining of the training was somehow strange. 
It took a long time to train for some reson. I would not use this for any purposes.
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version2/

Same as above it does not include the time difference just the improved time maps 
Well trained however, 
There is a bug. The network was training during the testing. It was not set to eval.
It will be retrained. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version3/

It got super slow for some reason Stopped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version4/

This is the improved version2 without the but and was trained with 100gb of memory.
This showed a better train. I did not see any bug so far. 
circa 400+ epochs. Accuracy little more then 0.82+. Loss around between 1.9 and 2.0. 
Best so far.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version5/
train 200+ epochs 100gb oif memory.
Events weighted with -3 gamma index. 
0.82+ accuracy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version6/
train 200+ epochs 200gb oif memory.
Events weighted with -3 gamma index. 
0.82+ accuracy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version7/
train 200+ epochs 200gb oif memory.
Events 5.0 to 6.0 weighted with -3 gamma index. 
Probably spcetal index ALL above not correct.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version8/
train 70+ epochs 200gb oif memory.
Events 4.0 to 7.0 weighted with -3 gamma index. 
Probably spcetal with better index, corrected.
No major results seen so far.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version9/
train 70+ epochs 200gb oif memory.
Events 5.0 to 7.0 weighted with -3 gamma index. 
Probably spcetal with better index, corrected.
No major results seen so far. Longer training probably 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
/hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/rn8463-gamma_hadron/version10/
train 70+ epochs 200gb oif memory.
Events 5.0 to 6.5 weighted with -3 gamma index. 
Probably spcetal with better index, corrected.
No major results seen so far.
