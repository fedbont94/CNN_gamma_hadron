*CNN for Gamma-Hadron Discrimination*


__author__ Federico Bontempo, PhD student KIT, Germany <federico.bontempo@kit.edu>

This is a Convolutional Neural Network used for the gamma proton discrimination. 

It uses pyhon3.9 and pytorch for the netowrk architecture.

The main function is cnn_gamma_hadron.py it can be run via cnn_gamma_hadron.sh

The testResult_plots.py is the function for plotting the training results of the network. 
You can run it via testResult_plots.sh
